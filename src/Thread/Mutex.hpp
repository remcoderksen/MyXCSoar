/**
 * This file is about mutexes.
 *
 * A mutex lock is also known as a mutually exclusive lock. This type of lock
 * is provided by many threading systems as a means of synchronization.
 * Basically, it is only possible for one thread to grab a mutex at a time:
 * if two threads try to grab a mutex, only one succeeds. The other thread
 * has to wait until the first thread releases the lock; it can then grab the
 * lock and continue operation.
